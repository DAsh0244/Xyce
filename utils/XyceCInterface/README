Code in this directory creates an interface to Xyce as a persistent object.  
It is used to provide both a ctypes-based Python interface and a Verilog 
Procedural Interface (VPI) to Xyce.  See the "Application Note: Mixed Signal 
Simulation with Xyce" document by Peter Sholander and Rich Schiek for more 
details on:

  1) How to build Xyce as "shared objects" that can be linked with, or 
invoked by, other simulators.  

  2) How to set up your Python environment to use the ctypes-based Python
interface to Xyce.  This entails changes to your PYTHONPATH and 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.

  3) Working examples for both Python and VPI.

Additional examples are also found in the subdirectories Python_examples
and VPI_examples.  For Xyce 6.10, the interfaces and examples have only 
been tested for a serial build of Xyce on RHEL6 and RHEL7.

The files UpdatePythonPath.sh and UpdateDynamicLinkerPath.sh are simple
"non-working" examples of how to set the PYTHONPATH and 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables with bash.  The directory
paths in those files must be modified for your local machine, as noted in 
the Application Note referenced above.  The file UpdateDynamicLinkerPath.sh
assumes that a make install build was used.

They can then be run as:

. ./UpdatePythonPath.sh
. ./UpdateDynamicLinkerPath.sh

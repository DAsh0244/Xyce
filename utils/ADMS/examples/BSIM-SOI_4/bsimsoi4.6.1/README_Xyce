In order to work in Xyce, several things in the BSIM SOI 4.6.1 code
needed modification.  These are documented here:


- Xyce/ADMS does not support the $port_connected function to specify
  optional nodes, and therefore the PORT_CONNECTED macro in the
  Verilog-A source has been left unset.  The B4SOI in Xyce can only
  have the thermal node internal, and does not provide access to the
  "p" and "b" nodes on the instance line.  The BODYMOD parameter is
  ignored and the model will always operate in floating body mode
  (bodymod=0).

- Several parameters designated as "instance" type in the Verilog-A
  source are also designated "Model" in the BSIM SOI documentation.
  These parameters have been given additional attributes to allow Xyce
  to treat them as both model and instance parameters.  If the model
  parameter is given and the instance not given, the instance
  parameter's value is set from the model parameter.  If the instance
  parameter is given, it is used as given.

- Bias-independent code has been wrapped in an ADMS-specific
  "@(initial_instance)" pseudo-event.  Doing so assures that this code
  is only executed when necessary --- at code initialization or
  whenever an instance or model parameter changes as part of a .STEP
  analysis.  As a consequence of this change, a line of code setting
  "DevTemp" to the ambient temperature needed to be duplicated both in
  the initial_instance and main body of the code.

- Explicit use of a multiplicity factor has been introduced.  Xyce
  does not have implicit multiplicity for devices, and requires that
  every device implement it explicitly.

- Several contributions contained both static and dynamic (ddt())
  terms, which ADMS and Xyce/ADMS mishandle.  These contributions were
  broken up into separate static-only and dynamic-only contributions.

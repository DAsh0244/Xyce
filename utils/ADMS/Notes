ADMS is powerful, but it basically is completely undocumented, and one
learns how to use it mostly by analysis of existing ADMS templates for
open source codes that use it.

Most of these notes were written in the very early days (circa 2008)
of trying to write Xyce/ADMS, when they came in much more handy than
they do now.  I tried to go through them in late 2019 just to make them
relevant again, since I'd forgotten this file even existed.

1)  <admst:value-of select="path"/>
    <admst:text format="%s"/>

     is the same as
    <admst:text format="%(path)"/>

----
2)  One can also apply templates without using "apply-templates":

    <admst:text format="$e=%(e(rhs/tree));\n"/>

    applies the template "e" to rhs/tree before output.

    This works fine  as long as what "e" does is output with "adms:text", and
    as long as we're using it to output with adms:text.  Where it becomes
    wrong is if one were trying, say, to create a variable with the output
    of "e" embedded in it.  That doesn't work:


    <admst:variable name="foo" select="%(e(rhs/tree))"/> 

    does NOT save the output of e(rhs/tree) into the variable foo.  To get
    that done generally requires using apply-templates to templates that
    don't do output (but rather return values).

   (Note added 2019: This is not strictly correct.  If e() has a "return"
   statement, one *can* access it and assign it to a variable by accessing
   more of the data path for the template, for example:
      <admst:variable name="foo" select="%(e(.)/[name='returnName']/value)"/>
   where the template "e" has a "<admst:return name="returnName" value="..."/>
   statement in it.

   Generally speaking, for reasons of readability and maintainability,
   I think use of template calls like this should probably be limited
   to templates that just perform a formatting action and return
   formatted data for output, not those that have side effects by
   modifying the ADMS data tree.  The explicit apply-templates syntax
   is better for that kind of work.

----
3) Each variable/parameter has a node called "parametertype" that defaults to
   "model".  Apparently, when there is an attribute called "type" in the
   parameter's definition, e.g.

`ifdef insideADMS
 `define P(p) (*p*)
 `define PGIVEN(p)              $given(p)
 `define INITIAL_MODEL          @(initial_model)
`else
 `define P(p)
 `define PGIVEN(p)              p
 `define INITIAL_MODEL          @(initial_step)
`endif
parameter real dt       = 0.0   `P(spice:name="dt" type="instance" info="Temperature change for particular transistor" unit="K");


then that parameter gets the "type" attribute turned into a
"parametertype".  NOTHING documents this fact except that if you look
at adms.xml it shows up there.  if you open the "math" top-level
entity then browse to "subexpression" and open it, then open
"variable" and then the associated "variableprototype" link, you'll
find a "parametertype" line.  Further expanding that you can find that
the acceptable values for the parameter type are "model," "instance,"
and "analogfunction" (for parameters passed to analog functions).

-----
4) Use of "return" from templates

   <admst:return name="returnname" value="text"/>

   This allows you to return values, and not even just a single value ---
   you can have multiple returns.  It is not a flow-of-control thing, but
   something that adds to the tree.

   Return values are retrieved pretty easily.

   <admst:apply-templates select="/path" match="templatename">
     <admst:value-of select="returned('returnname')/value"/>
     <admst:variable name="variablename" select="%s"/>
   </admst:apply-templates>

   See also note 2, where it is also possible to use an abbreviated version
   of this like:
     <admst:variable name="variablename" select="%(templatename(/path)/[name='returnname']/value)"/>
   which should be exactly the same as the four-line version above.

-------

5) apply-templates will work as a loop over all members of a
   container.  For example, a block often (usually) has multiple
   items.  Doing:

   <admst:apply-templates select="item" match="sometemplate"/>

   while . is a block will apply sometemplate to each item in the block.  It
   is pretty much equivalent to:
     <admst:for-each select="item">
       <admst:apply-templates select="." match="sometemplate"/>
     </admst:for-each>

6) "if-inside" and "if-not-inside" are admst commands that check for the presence of a value in a list:
      <admst:if-inside select="$derivProbe" list="%(probe)">
        <admst:variable name="expressionDeriv" select="d_%(name)_d%($derivProbe/nature/access)_%($derivProbe/branch/pnode/name)_%($derivProbe/branch/nnode/name)"/>
      </admst:if-inside>
   That is, if the probe stored in $derivProbe is in the list "probe" that
   is part of the path element currently being processed, do something.

  Completely undocumented, learned only through email with Laurent Lamaitre:

  You can push an array of items or a scalar value into any part of the
  ADMS data tree using the "@variable" or "#variable" constructs.  These are
  used in the uncommented, undocumented adms scripts "arobavariable.xml" and
  "croixvariable.xml"

  On Laurent's recommendation, I used this feature in the
  "collectAssignedVariables" template.  This template recursively gathers a
  list of all the variables that are on the left-hand-side of any assignment
  at or below the part of the tree passed to it.  It is roughly patterned on
  a similar template in qucs, ng-spice, and zspice ("block:local:variables")
  that used a deprecated part of the adms data tree
  (/module/evaluation/variable).

  To use this method to push something into an array, you can do:

   <admst:push into="/some/data/path/@variable" select="somenode"/>

 which will create the @variable sub-node of /some/data/path if it doesn't
 exist and add somenode to that list.

   <admst:push into="/some/data/path/#variable" select="somevalue"/>

 pushes a scalar named #variable, and assigns it the given value instead.

 admst:push takes an "onduplicate" option that allows one to control what it
 does if there's already a value in the list like the one you're pushing:

   onduplicate="ignore"  --- do nothing (don't push), the default
   onduplicate="abort"   --- exit with error
   onduplicate="ignore-abort" --- ??
   onduplicate="passthrough"  --- ??

----------------
Documented, but not obvious:

-  The module tree contains a "contribution" item that is a list of all the
   contributions that appear in the module.  This will be *vital* to use
   for Xyce's purposes, as it means there's one place we can go to figure out
   all of the dependencies between probes on the RHS of contributions and
   currents on the LHS.  It will also probably help to figure out how to 
   declare the Sacado Fad types.

- DUH!  There is a /module/jacobian item that tells EXACTLY what
   jacobian terms arise from the various contributions.  This should
   make jacstamp and offset generation very simple.  But this data
   structure contains ONLY information from conttributions of the form
   "I(branch) <+ expression", and no information from "V(branch) <+
   expression."  The latter makes things much more complicated and
   introduces new variables and equations, and must be handled
   ourselves.  (Xyce/ADMS has supported this through various
   templating hacks since 2011, see morannon bug 1779, the template
   "collectExtraUnknowns" in xyceBasicTemplates, and use of the
   "@extraUknowns" arobavar throughout our code generation templates.)

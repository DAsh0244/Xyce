\begin{OptionTable}{Options for Embedded Sampling Package.} \label{EmbeddedSamplesPKG}
NUMSAMPLES   & Total number of samples & 0 \\ \hline
SAMPLE\_TYPE & Sampling type (MC or LHS) & MC \\ \hline
OUTPUTS      & Comma separated list of outputs (anything that would be a valid \texttt{.RESULT} output command) & -- \\ \hline
COVMATRIX    & Covariance matrix specified in row major form as comma-separated double precision numbers. & -- \\ \hline
SEED         & Random seed & See footnote.\footnotemark[1] \\ \hline
\end{OptionTable}

\footnotetext[1]{The seed can also be set using command line option, -randseed.   The command line seed will override the netlist seed value.  If the seed is not set in either the netlist or on the command line, then Xyce generates a seed internally.  In all cases, \Xyce{} will output text to the console indicating what seed is being used.}

Calculates the the small signal noise response of a circuit over a range of frequencies.
The .NOISE command can specify a linear sweep, decade logarithmic sweep, or octave logarithmic sweep.

\begin{Command}

\format
\begin{alltt}
  .NOISE V(OUTPUT <, REF>) SRC <sweep type> <points value>
+ <start frequency value> <end frequency value>
\end{alltt}

\examples
\begin{alltt}
  .NOISE V(5) VIN LIN 101 100Hz 200Hz
  .NOISE V(5,3) V1 OCT 10 1kHz 16kHz
  .NOISE V(4) V2 DEC 20 1MEG 100MEG
\end{alltt}

\arguments

\begin{Arguments}

\argument{V(OUTPUT <,REF>)}
   The node at which the total output noise is desired. If REF is 
   specified, then the noise voltage V(OUTPUT) - V(REF) is calculated. By default, 
   REF is assumed to be ground. 

\argument{SRC}
   The name of an independent source to which input noise is referred. 

\argument{sweep type}

Must be \texttt{LIN}, \texttt{OCT}, or \texttt{DEC}, as described below.
\begin{description}

\item[\tt LIN] Linear sweep\\
The sweep variable is swept linearly from the starting to the ending value.

\item[\tt OCT] Sweep by octaves\\
The sweep variable is swept logarithmically by octaves.

\item[\tt DEC] Sweep by decades\\
The sweep variable is swept logarithmically by decades.

\end{description}

\argument{points value}
Specifies the number of points in the sweep, using an integer.

\argument{\vbox{\hbox{start frequency value\hfil}\hbox{end frequency value}}}

The end frequency value must not be less than the start frequency value,
and both must be greater than zero. The whole sweep must include at
least one point.

\end{Arguments}

\comments

Noise analysis is a linear analysis. The simulator calculates the noise
response by linearizing the circuit around the bias point.

\index{\texttt{.PRINT}}\index{results!print}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{NOISE}}
A \texttt{.PRINT NOISE} must be used to get the results of the NOISE sweep
analysis.  See Section \ref{.PRINT}.

Noise analysis is a relatively new feature to \Xyce{}, so not all noise models
have been supported.

Power calculations (\texttt{P(<device>} and \texttt{W(<device>}) are not supported for any
devices for noise analysis.  Current variables (e.g., \texttt{I(<device>)} are only supported
for devices that have ``branch currents'' that are part of the solution vector. This includes
the V, E, H and L devices.  It also includes the voltage-form of the B device.

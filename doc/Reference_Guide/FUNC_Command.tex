User defined functions that can be used in expressions appearing later
in the same scope as the \texttt{.FUNC} statement.

\begin{Command}
\format
.FUNC <name>([arg]*) \{<body>\}

\examples
\begin{alltt}
.FUNC E(x) \{exp(x)\}
.FUNC DECAY(CNST) \{E(-CNST*TIME)\}
.FUNC TRIWAV(x) \{ACOS(COS(x))/3.14159\}
.FUNC MIN3(A,B,C) \{MIN(A,MIN(B,C))\}
\end{alltt}

\arguments

\begin{Arguments}
\argument{name}

Function name.  Functions cannot be redefined and the function name must 
not be the same as any of the
predefined functions (e.g., \texttt{SIN} and \texttt{SQRT}).  

\argument{arg}

The arguments to the function.  \texttt{.FUNC} arguments cannot be node names.
The number of arguments in the use of a function must agree with the number 
in the definition. Parameters, TIME, and other functions are allowed in 
the body of function definitions.  \index{constants (\texttt{EXP},\texttt{PI})}
Two constants \texttt{EXP} and \texttt{PI} cannot
be used a argument names.  These constants are equal to $e$ and $\pi$, respectively,
and cannot be redefined.

\argument{body}

May refer to other (previously defined) functions; the second example, 
DECAY, uses the first example, E. 

\end{Arguments}

\comments

The \texttt{<body>} of a defined function is handled in the same way as any 
math expression; it must be enclosed in curly braces {}.

\index{\texttt{.FUNC}!subcircuit scoping}The scoping rules for functions are:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item If a \texttt{.FUNC}, statement is included in the main circuit 
netlist, then it is accessible from the main circuit and all subcircuits. 
\item \texttt{.FUNC} statements defined within a subcircuit are scoped 
to that subciruit definition.  So, their functions are only accessible within 
that subcircuit definition, as well as within ``nested subcircuits'' also 
defined within that subcircuit definition.
\end{XyceItemize}

Additional illustative examples of scoping are given in the
``Working with Subcircuits and Models'' section of the \Xyce{} Users' 
Guide\UsersGuide.  

\end{Command}

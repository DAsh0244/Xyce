\arguments

\begin {Arguments}

\argument{ov}
The desired solution output to be analyzed. Only one
output variable can be specified on a {\tt .FFT} line. However,
multiple {\tt .FFT} lines with the same output variable but, for
example, different windowing functions may be used in a netlist.
The available outputs are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{V(<circuit node>)} the voltage at \texttt{<circuit node>}
  \item \texttt{V(<circuit node>,<circuit node>)} to output the voltage
    difference between the first \texttt{<circuit node>} and second
    \texttt{<circuit node>}
  \item \texttt{I(<device>)} the current through a two terminal device
  \item \texttt{I<lead abbreviation>(<device>)} the current into a particular lead
    of a three or more terminal device (see the Comments, below, for details)
  \item \texttt{N(<device parameter>)} a specific device parameter (see the
    individual devices in Section~\ref{Analog_Devices} for syntax)
\end{itemize}

\argument{NP}
The number of points in the FFT.  This value must be a power of 2.  If
the user-entered value is not a power of two then it will be rounded to
the nearest power of 2.  The minimum allowed value of {\tt NP} is 4.
The default value is 1024.

\argument{WINDOW}
The windowing function that will be applied to the sampled waveform
values.  The allowed values are as follows, where table~\ref{FFT_Window_Funcs}
gives their exact definitions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{RECT} = rectangular window (default)
  \item \texttt{BART} = Bartlett (triangular) window
  \item \texttt{HANN} = Hanning window
  \item \texttt{HAMM} = Hamming window
  \item \texttt{BLACK} = Blackman window
  \item \texttt{HARRIS} = Blackman-Harris window
\end{itemize}

\argument{ALFA}
This parameter is supported for HSPICE compatibility. It currently
has no effect though, since the {\tt GAUSS} and {\tt KAISER} windows
are not supported.

\argument{FORMAT}
The allowed values are {\tt NORM} and {\tt UNORM}.  The default
value is {\tt NORM}. If {\tt NORM} is selected then the magnitude
values will be normalized to the largest magnitude.  If {\tt UNORM}
is selected then the actual magnitude values will be output instead.

\argument{START}
The start time for the FFT analysis.  The default value is the
start time for the transient analysis. {\tt FROM} is an allowed
synonym for {\tt START}.

\argument{STOP}
The end time for the FFT analysis.  The default value is the
end time for the transient analysis. {\tt TO} is an allowed
synonym for {\tt STOP}.

\argument{FREQ}
The ``first harmonic'' of the frequencies provided in the output
file.  The default value for {\tt FREQ} is {\tt 1/(STOP - START)}.
If {\tt FREQ} is given then it is rounded to the nearest integer
multiple of the default value.  The \Xyce{} Users' Guide\UsersGuide
provides an example.

\argument{FMIN}
This parameter can use to adjust the harmonics included in the
``additional metrics'' defined in Section \ref{FFT_metrics}.  It
has a default value of 1.

\argument{FMAX}
This parameter can use to adjust the harmonics included in the
``additional metrics'' defined in Section \ref{FFT_metrics}.  It
has a default value of \texttt{NP/2}.

\end{Arguments}

\comments
Multiple \texttt{.FFT} lines may be used in a netlist.  All results from FFT analyses
will be returned to the user in a file with the same name as the netlist file suffixed
with \texttt{.fftX} where {\tt X} is the step number.

\texttt{<lead abbreviation>} is a single character designator for individual
leads on a device with three or more leads.  For bipolar transistors these are:
c (collector), b (base), e (emitter), and s (substrate).  For mosfets, lead
abbreviations are: d (drain), g (gate), s (source), and b (bulk).  SOI
transistors have: d, g, s, e (bulk), and b (body).  For PDE devices, the nodes
are numbered according to the order they appear, so lead currents are
referenced like I1(\texttt{<device>}), I2(\texttt{<device>}), etc.

For this analysis, the phase data is always output in degrees.

\end{Command}

Table~\ref{FFT_Window_Funcs} gives the definitions of the window functions
implemented in \Xyce{}.  For HSPICE compatibility, the {\tt BLACK} window type
is actually the ``-67 dB Three-Term Blackman-Harris window''~\cite{Doerry2017}
rather than the ``Conventional Blackman Window'' used by Matlab and scipy.
The definition of the {\tt BART} window type ~\cite{oppenheimSchafer} was chosen
to match Matlab and scipy.  The \Xyce{} definition may differ from HSPICE.

\subsubsection{Additional FFT Metrics}
\label{FFT_metrics}
The following additional metrics will be sent to stdout if \texttt{.OPTIONS FFT FFTOUT=1}
is used in the netlist.  These definitions are also used by the corresponding measure
types on \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} lines.

Define the integer index of the ``first harmonic'' ($f_{0}$) as follows (where it has a
default value of 1 and the $ROUND()$ function rounds to the nearest integer):

$f_{0}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}ROUND(\frac{FREQ}{STOP-START}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{if FREQ given} \\
 1,\hspace*{1.4in}\textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$

Finally, define $mag[i]$ as the magnitude of the FFT coefficient at index $i$, and $N$ as
the number of points in the FFT.

The Signal to Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio (SNDR) is calculated as follows, where the summation
in the denominator includes all of the frequencies except for the first harmonic frequency $f_{0}$:

$SNDR = 20 \cdot log10(\frac{mag[f_{0}]}{sqrt(\sum mag[i]*mag[i])}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{for}~1 \leq i \leq 0.5 \cdot N ~\textrm{, and}~i \neq f_{0}$

The Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is calculated as follows, where the units is ``bits'':

$ENOB = \frac{SNDR - 1.76}{6.02}$

For the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) metric define the upper frequency limit for the SNR metric as follows,
with the caveat that if $f_{2}$ is less than $f_{0}$ then its value is set to $f_{0}$:

$f_{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}ROUND(\frac{FMAX}{STOP-START}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{if FMAX given}\\
   0.5 \cdot N,\hspace*{1.1in}\textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$

The SNR is then calculated as follows, where the summation in the denominator only uses indexes that
are either not an integer-multiple of $f_{0}$ or that are greater than the upper frequency limit of $f_{2}$.
(Note: for the default case of $f_{0}$ = 1 and \texttt{FMAX} not given there are no ``noise frequencies''.)

$SNR = 20 \cdot log10(\frac{mag[f_{0}]}{sqrt(\sum mag[i]*mag[i])}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{for}~i > f_{2} ~\textrm{ or }~i\%f_{0} \ne 0$

For the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) metric define the upper frequency limit ($f_{2}$) in
the summation in the numerator as:

$f_{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}ROUND(\frac{FMAX}{STOP-START}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{if FMAX given} \\ 0.5 \cdot N,\hspace*{1.1in}\textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$

The THD is then calculated using only the indexes that are multiples of $f_{0}$.  So, if $f_{0}$=2
then the summation in the numerator would only include indexes 4,6,8,etc.

$THD = 20 \cdot log10(\frac{sqrt(\sum mag[i]*mag[i])}{mag[f_{0}]}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{for}~2 \cdot f_{0} \leq i \leq f_{2} ~\textrm{, and}~i\%f_{0}=0$

For Spurious Free Distortion Ratio (SFDR) metric define the upper and lower frequency
limits ($f_{2}$ and $f_{1}$) considered in the denominator of the calculation as:

$f_{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}ROUND(\frac{FMAX}{STOP-START}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{if FMAX given} \\
 0.5 \cdot N,\hspace*{1.1in}\textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$

and:

$f_{1}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}ROUND(\frac{FMIN}{STOP-START}),\hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{if FMIN given} \\
 f_{0},\hspace*{1.35in}\textrm{if FMIN not given, and}~f_{2} \geq f_{0}\\
 1,\hspace*{1.4in}\textrm{if FMIN not given, and}~f_{2} < f_{0}\end{array}\right.$

The SFDR is then calculated as:

$SFDR = 20 \cdot log10(\frac{mag[f_{0}]}{MAX(mag[i])}), \hspace*{0.1in}\textrm{for}~f_{1} \leq i \leq f_{2}~\textrm{, and}~i \neq f_{0}$

\subsubsection{Re-Measure}
\label{Measure_FFT_ReMeasure}
\index{measure fft!re-measure}
\Xyce{} can re-calculate (or re-measure) the values for {\tt .FFT} statements
using existing \Xyce{} output files.  Section~\ref{Measure_ReMeasure} discusses
this topic in more detail for both {\tt .MEASURE} and {\tt .FFT} statements. One
additional caveat is that \texttt{FFT\_ACCURATE} is set to 0 during the re-measure
operation.  This should have no impact of the accuracy of the re-measured results
if the output file was previously generated with \texttt{FFT\_ACCURATE} set to 1.

\subsubsection{Compatibility Between OUTPUT and FFT Options}
Some \texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT} settings are incompatible with using the default
setting of \texttt{.OPTIONS FFT FFT\_ACCURATE=1}.  The use of
\texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT OUTPUTTIMEPOINTS} is compatible.  However, the use of
\texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT INITIAL\_INTERVAL} is not.  In that latter case,
\texttt{.OPTIONS FFT FFT\_ACCURATE} will be automatically set to 0.

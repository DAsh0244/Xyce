\label{Measure_CONT_section}

``Continuous'' measure results are supported for \texttt{DERIV-AT},
\texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-AT}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and \texttt{WHEN}
measures, for \texttt{.TRAN}, \texttt{.DC}, \texttt{.AC} and \texttt{.NOISE}
analyses.  They are identical to the ``non-continuous'' versions, except that
they can return more than one measured value in some cases.  Continuous
measure mode is not supported for \texttt{TRIG} or \texttt{TARG} measures.

\arguments

\begin{Arguments}
\argument{result name}

Measured results are reported to the log file and (possibly) multiple
output files. Section~\ref{Measure_CONT_Measurement_Output} below gives more
information on the output files produced by continuous mode measures.

The \texttt{<result name>} must be a legal \Xyce{} character string.
If multiple measures are defined with the same \texttt{<result name>} then
\Xyce{} uses the last such definition, and issues warning messages about
(and discards) any previous measure definitions with the same
\texttt{<result name>}.

\argument{measure type}

\texttt{DERIV, FIND, WHEN}

The third argument specifies the type of measurement or calculation to
be done.

By default, the measurement is performed over the entire simulation.
The calculations can be limited to a specific measurement window by
using the qualifiers {\tt FROM}, {\tt TO}, {\tt TD}, {\tt RISE}, {\tt
FALL}, {\tt CROSS} and {\tt MINVAL}, which are explained below and in
section~\ref{Measure_section}..

The supported ``continuous'' measure types and their definitions are:

\begin{description}
 \item[\tt DERIV] Computes the derivative of {\tt <variable>} at a
    user-specified time (by using the {\tt AT} qualifier) or when a
    user-specified condition occurs (by using the {\tt WHEN}
    qualifier). If the {\tt WHEN} qualifier is used then the
    measurement window can be limited with the qualifiers {\tt FROM},
    {\tt TO}, {\tt RISE}, {\tt FALL} and {\tt CROSS} for all measure
    modes.  In addition, the {\tt TD} qualifier is supported for
    {\tt TRAN\_CONT} measures. The {\tt MINVAL} qualifier is used as a
    comparison tolerance for both {\tt AT} and {\tt WHEN}.  For HSPICE
    compatibility, {\tt DERIVATIVE} is an allowed synonym for {\tt
    DERIV}.

   \item[\tt FIND-AT] Returns the value of {\tt <variable>} at the
    time when the {\tt AT} clause is satisfied.  The {\tt AT}
    clause is described in more detail later in this list.

  \item[\tt FIND-WHEN] Returns the value of {\tt <variable>} at the
    time when the {\tt WHEN} clause is satisfied.  The {\tt WHEN}
    clause is described in more detail later in this list.

  \item[\tt WHEN] Returns the time (or frequency or DC sweep value) when
    {\tt <variable>} reaches {\tt <variable\(\sb{2}\)>} or the constant
    value, {\tt value}.  The measurement window can be limited with the
    qualifiers {\tt FROM}, {\tt TO}, {\tt RISE}, {\tt FALL} and {\tt CROSS}
    for all measure modes.  In addition, the {\tt TD} qualifier is supported
    for {\tt TRAN\_CONT} measures. The qualifier {\tt MINVAL} acts as a
    tolerance for the comparison.  For example when {\tt <variable\(\sb{2}\)>}
    is specified, the comparison used is when {\tt <variable>} $=$
    {\tt <variable\(\sb{2}\)>} $\pm$ {\tt MINVAL} or when a constant,
    {\tt value} is given: {\tt <variable>} $=$ {\tt value} $\pm$ {\tt
    MINVAL}.  If the conditions specified for finding a given value
    were not found during the simulation then the measure will return
    the default value of {\tt -1}.  The user may change this default
    value with the {\tt DEFAULT\_VAL} qualifier.  Note: The use of
    {\tt FIND} and {\tt WHEN} in one measure statement is also supported.
\end{description}

\argument{\vbox{\hbox{variable\hfil}\hbox{variable\(\sb{n}\)\hfil}\hbox{value}}}

These quantities represents the test for the stated
measurement.  \texttt{<variable>} is a simulation quantity, such as a
voltage or current.  One can compare it to another simulation variable
or a fixed quantity.  Additionally, the \texttt{<variable>} may be
a \Xyce{} expression delimited by \{ \} brackets.  As noted above, an
example is {\tt V(2)=0.75}
\end{Arguments}

Additional information on the \texttt{TO}, \texttt{FROM}, \texttt{TD},
\texttt{RISE}, \texttt{FALL}, \texttt{CROSS}, \texttt{MINVAL},
\texttt{DEFAUAL\_VAL}, \texttt{PRECISION} and \texttt{PRINT} qualifiers
is given in section~\ref{Measure_section}.

\subsubsection{Measure Output}
\label{Measure_CONT_Measurement_Output}
\index{measure continuous!measurement output}
As discussed in section~\ref{Measure_Measurement_Output}, measured results
for \texttt{AC}, \texttt{DC}, \texttt{NOISE} and \texttt{TRAN} mode measures
are reported to the log file.  Additionally, for \texttt{TRAN} measures, the
results are stored in files called \texttt{circuitFileName.mt\#}, where the
suffixed number (\texttt{\#}) starts at \texttt{0} and increases for multiple
iterations (\texttt{.STEP} iterations) of a given simulation. For \texttt{DC}
measures, the results are stored in the files \texttt{circuitFileName.ms\#},
while \texttt{AC} and \texttt{NOISE} measures use the files
\texttt{circuitFileName.ma\#}.

For \texttt{AC\_CONT}, \texttt{DC\_CONT}, \texttt{NOISE\_CONT} and
\texttt{TRAN\_CONT} mode measures, the output for successful and failed
measures is sent to the standard output (and log files), as described in
section ~\ref{Measure_Measurement_Output}.  There are two options for the
output files though. The default is for each continuous mode measure to generate its
own output file where, for example for a non-step transient analysis, the file name
would be \texttt{circuitFileName\_resultname.mt0} where the result (measure) name is
always output in lower-case. This default matches HSPICE. The second option uses
\texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE USE\_CONT\_FILES=0}. In that case, the results for all
of the continuous mode measures are sent to the \texttt{circuitFileName.mt\#} file.
An example is as follows.

\subsubsection{HSPICE Compatibility}
\label{Measure_CONT__HSpice_Compatibility}
\index{measure continuous!HSPICE compatibility}
There are known incompatibilities between the \Xyce{} and HSPICE implementation
of {\tt .MEASURE}.  They include the following:

The \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} statement allows calculation or reporting of simulation
metrics, from data associated with .FFT analyses, to an external file as well as to
the standard output and/or a log file, So, it is only supported for \texttt{.TRAN},
analyses.  It can be used with {\tt .STEP}.  For HSPICE compatibility, \texttt{.MEAS}
is an allowed synonym for \texttt{.MEASURE}.

The syntaxes for the \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} statements are shown below.

\arguments

\begin{Arguments}
\argument{result name}

Measured results are reported to the output and log file.
Additionally, the results are stored in files called
\texttt{circuitFileName.mt\#}, where the suffixed number
(\texttt{\#}) starts at \texttt{0} and increases for multiple
iterations (\texttt{.STEP} iterations) of a given simulation. Each
line of this file will contain the measurement name, \texttt{<result
name>}, followed by its value for that run.  The \texttt{<result
name>} must be a legal \Xyce{} character string.

If multiple measures are defined with the same \texttt{<result name>} then
\Xyce{} uses the last such definition, and issues warning messages about
(and discards) any previous measure definitions with the same
\texttt{<result name>}.

\argument{measure type}

\texttt{ENOB, EQN, FIND, SFDR, SNDR, SNR, THD}

The third argument specifies the type of measurement or calculation to
be done.

By default, the measurement is performed over the time window defined
by the {\tt START} and {\tt STOP} parameters on the associated {\tt .FFT}
line.  So, the  {\tt FROM}, {\tt TO} and {\tt TD} qualifiers have no
effect on FFT-based measures.

The supported measure types are:

\begin{description}
  \item[\tt ENOB] Calculates the ``Effective Number of Bits'', where that metric
    is defined further below.

  \item[\tt EQN] Calculates the value of {\tt <expression>} during the simulation.
    That expression can use the results of other measure statements. {\tt PARAM}
    is an allowed synonym for {\tt EQN} as a measure type.

  \item[\tt FIND] Returns the requested FFT cofficient at the requested
    frequency.  Examples of the mapping of \Xyce{} operators (e.g., {\tt VM})
    to FFT cofficients are given below.  {\tt FIND} measures can be
    used in conjunction with {\tt EQN} measures to generate arbitrary
    FFT-based measures.  An example of that is also given below.

  \item[\tt SFDR] Calculates the ``Spurious Free Dynamic Range'', where that metric
    is defined further below.

  \item[\tt SFDR] Calculates the ``Signal to Noise-plus-Distortion Ratio'', where that metric
    is defined further below.

  \item[\tt SNR] Calculates the ``Signal to Noise Ratio'', where that metric
    is defined further below.

  \item[\tt THD] Calculates the ``Total Harmonic Distortion'', where that metric
    is defined further below.
\end{description}

\argument{\vbox{\hbox{variable\hfil}\hbox{variable\(\sb{n}\)\hfil}\hbox{value}}}

These quantities represents the test for the stated
measurement.  \texttt{<variable>} is a simulation quantity, such as a
voltage or current.  Additionally, the \texttt{<variable>} may be
a \Xyce{} expression delimited by \{ \} brackets.  The only constraint
is that the \texttt{variable} on the \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} line must
be an exact match for the \texttt{ov} on at least one \texttt{.FFT} line
in the netlist.

\argument{AT=value}
A frequency {\em at which} the measurement calculation will occur.  This is
used by the {\tt FIND} measure only.  The entered {\tt AT} value will be
rounded to the nearest harmonic frequency, as defined by the {\tt FREQ},
{\tt START} and {\tt STOP} parameters on the associated {\tt .FFT} line.

\argument{DEFAULT\_VAL=value}

If the conditions specified for finding a given value are not found
during the simulation then the measure will return the default value
of {\tt -1} in the \texttt{circuitFileName.mt\#} file.
The measure value in the standard output or log file will be
FAILED.  The default return value for the \texttt{circuitFileName.mt\#}
file is settable by the user for each measure by adding the qualifier
{\tt DEFAULT\_VAL=<retval>} on that measure line.  If either
\texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASFAIL=<val>} or
\texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE DEFAULT\_VAL=<val>} are given in the
netlist then those values override the \texttt{DEFAULT\_VAL}
parameters given on individual \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} lines.
See Section \ref{Options_Reference} for more details.

\argument{NBHARM}
The maximum number of harmonics over which to perform a THD measure.
The default is {\tt NP/2}, where {\tt NP} is the number of points
specified on the associated {\tt .FFT} line.

\argument{PRECISION=value}

The default precision for {\tt .MEASURE} output is 6 digits after the
decimal point.  This argument provides a user configurable precision
for a given {\tt .MEASURE} statement that applies to both the
\texttt{.mt\#} file and standard output.
If \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASDGT=<val>} is given in the netlist
then that value overrides the \texttt{PRECISION} parameters given on
individual \texttt{.MEASURE} lines.

\argument{PRINT=value}

This parameter controls where the {\tt .MEASURE} output appears.  The
default is {\tt ALL}, which produces measure output in both the
\texttt{.mt\#} and the standard output.  A value of {\tt STDOUT}
only produces measure output to standard output, while a value of
{\tt NONE} suppresses the measure output to both the \texttt{.mt\#}
file and standard output.

\end{Arguments}

\end {Command}

\subsubsection{Re-Measure}
\label{Measure_FFT_ReMeasure}
\index{measure fft!re-measure}
\Xyce{} can re-calculate (or re-measure) the values for {\tt .MEASURE FFT}
statements using existing \Xyce{} output files.  Section~\ref{Measure_ReMeasure}
discusses this topic in more detail for both {\tt .MEASURE} and {\tt .FFT}
statements.

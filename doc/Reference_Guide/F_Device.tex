\parameters

\begin{Parameters}

\param{\vbox{\hbox{(+) node\hfil}\hbox{(-) node}}}
Output nodes. Positive current flows from the \texttt{(+)} node through
the source to the \texttt{(-)} node.

\param{controlling V device}
The controlling voltage source which must be an independent voltage source
(V device).

\end{Parameters}

\comments

In the first form, a specified current through a controlling device is
multiplied by the gain to determine this device's output current.  The
gain may be expressed either as a number, a parameter, or an arbitrary
brace-delimited ABM expression.

The second form using the \texttt{POLY} keyword is used in analog behavioral
modeling.

Both forms are automatically converted within \Xyce{} to its principal
ABM device, the \texttt{B} nonlinear dependent source device. See the B-source
section (\ref{B_Source_Device}) and the \Xyce{} User's Guide for more guidance
on analog behavioral modeling.  For details concerning the use of the
\texttt{POLY} format, see section~\ref{PspicePoly}.

The power supplied or dissipated by this source device is calculated 
with $I \cdot \Delta V$ where the voltage drop is calculated as $(V_+ - V_-)$ 
and positive current flows from $V_+$ to $V_-$.  Dissipated power has a
positive sign, while supplied power has a negative sign.

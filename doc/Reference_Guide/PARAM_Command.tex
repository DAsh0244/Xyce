User defined parameter that can be used in expressions throughout the netlist.

\begin{Command}

\format
.PARAM [<name>=<value>]*

\examples
\begin{alltt}
.PARAM A_Param=1K
.PARAM B_Param=\{A_Param*3.1415926535\}
\end{alltt}

\arguments

\begin{Arguments}
\argument{\vbox{\hbox{name\hfil}\hbox{value}}}

The name of a parameter and its value.
\medskip

\end{Arguments}

\comments
Parameters defined using \verb+.PARAM+ are evaluated when the netlist is read in, and therefore must evaluate to constants at the time the netlist is parsed.  It is therefore illegal to use any time- or solution-dependent terms in parameter definitions, including the TIME, FREQ, TEMP and VT variables or any nodal voltages.   Since they must be constants, these parameters may also not be used in \texttt{.STEP} loops.

There are several reserved words that may not be used as names for parameters.  These parameters are:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \verb+Time+
\item \verb+Freq+ 
\item \verb+Vt+
\item \verb+Temp+
\item \verb+GMIN+
\end{XyceItemize}

\index{\texttt{.PARAM}!subcircuit scoping}The scoping rules for parameters are:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item If a \texttt{.PARAM}, statement is included in the main circuit 
netlist, then it is accessible from the main circuit and all subcircuits. 
\item \texttt{.PARAM} statements defined within a subcircuit are scoped 
to that subciruit definition.  So, their parameters are only accessible within 
that subcircuit definition, as well as within ``nested subcircuits'' also 
defined within that subcircuit definition.
\end{XyceItemize}

Additional illustative examples of scoping are given in the
``Working with Subcircuits and Models'' section of the \Xyce{} Users' 
Guide\UsersGuide.

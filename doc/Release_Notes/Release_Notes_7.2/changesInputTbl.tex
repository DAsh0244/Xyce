The precedence of FROM and TO versus AT was made identical for the DERIV
and FIND measures. & The \texttt{FROM} and \texttt{TO} qualifiers now both
take precedence over the \texttt{AT} qualifier for both \texttt{DERIV}
and \texttt{FIND} measures.  This behavior matches other simulators.
\\ \hline

The RISE, FALL and CROSS qualifiers are no longer supported for TRAN-mode
AVG, INTEG and RMS measures. & This changes makes the qualifier support
for those three measure types consistent for all four measure modes
(AC, DC, NOISE and TRAN).  This is also consistent with HSPICE.
\\ \hline

The Xyce-specific RFC\_LEVEL qualifier is no longer supported for the
DERIV-WHEN, FIND-WHEN and WHEN measures & That qualifier was added to
improve the performance of the \texttt{RISE}, \texttt{FALL} and
\texttt{CROSS} qualifiers for \texttt{MAX}, \texttt{MIN} and \texttt{PP}
measures, and the performance of the \Xyce{}-specific \texttt{FRAC\_MAX}
qualifier for \texttt{TRIG} and \texttt{TARG} measures.  It was not
particularly useful for \texttt{WHEN} measures.  This change simplified
the addition of ``continuous measures''.

\textbf{Gitlab-ex 40}: Xyce/ADMS incorrectly omitting variable declaration in obscure use cases &
As a result of a design flaw that has been fixed in this release,
previous versions of Xyce/ADMS would incorrectly omit the declaration
of a module-scoped variable if the only use of that variable was in a
lower-level block and an earlier block had a local variable of the
same name. \\ \hline
\textbf{Gitlab-ex 24, 390-SON}: Xyce/ADMS does not support \$port\_connected &
The Verilog-A construct ``\$port\_connected'' tests whether an
optional node has been specified on the instance line of a device.
Using this construct anywhere in a Verilog-A model implicitly
designates the named node as optional.  Xyce/ADMS now supports this
construct in a limited sense.  See the Xyce/ADMS users guide for
details. \\ \hline
\textbf{812-SON}: Incorrect response when N or V is used as a global param name &
Use of a \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} statement to define a parameter which
had a name identical to a valid print line accessor function
(e.g. ``V'' or ``N'') would result in error messages of the form
``Function or variable ... is not defined'' when that accessor was
used on a print line, with the undefined variable being the node or
device name inside the parentheses of the accessor.  This was a bug in
handling of global parameters, and the only workaround had been to
avoid such parameter names.  This workaround is no longer
necessary. \\ \hline

\textbf{1310-SON}: Improve FROM and TO info printed to stdout for AC,
DC and Noise measures & The information printed to stdout for the
start and end points of the measurement window, for AC, DC and NOISE
measures, is now correct for cases where the FROM and/or TO values
are not equal to a sweep value.  That information is also now
correct for DERIV-WHEN, FIND-WHEN and WHEN measures.
\\ \hline

\textbf{1307-SON}: Improve Compatibility of .MEASURE with .DATA &
If a \texttt{.DATA} statement is used to define a table-based sweep
on a \texttt{.DC} line then \texttt{DC} measures now correctly use
the row index in that table as their ``swept variable''.  The
\texttt{.MEASURE} section of the \Xyce{} Reference Guide provides
an example of this use case.
\\ \hline

\textbf{1306-SON}: Fix FROM and TO qualifiers for DC mode measures &
The \texttt{FROM} and \texttt{TO} qualifiers would work correctly if
either both were used on a \texttt{.MEASURE DC} line, or if neither
was used.  Measures such as these now also work correctly for all
supported DC measure types:
\begin{verbatim}
.measure dc maxFrom max v(1) FROM=4
.measure dc minTo min v(1) TO=4
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

\textbf{1303-SON}: Segfault in mixed signal interface &
The Python method \texttt{getDeviceNames()}, and the underlying
\texttt{xyce\_getDeviceNames()} method in the mixed signal interface,
would segfault if invoked for some model groups (e.g, D, L and M) when
there were no devices from that model group in the \Xyce{} netlist.

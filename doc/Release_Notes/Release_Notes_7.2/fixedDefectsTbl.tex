\textbf{1303-SON}: Segfault in mixed signal interface &
The Python method \texttt{getDeviceNames()}, and the underlying
\texttt{xyce\_getDeviceNames()} method in the mixed signal interface,
would segfault if invoked for some model groups (e.g, D, L and M) when
there were no devices from that model group in the \Xyce{} netlist.

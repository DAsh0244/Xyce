\textbf{812-SON}: Incorrect response when N or V is used as a global param name &
Use of a \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} statement to define a parameter which
had a name identical to a valid print line accessor function
(e.g. ``V'' or ``N'') would result in error messages of the form
``Function or variable ... is not defined'' when that accessor was
used on a print line, with the undefined variable being the node or
device name inside the parentheses of the accessor.  This was a bug in
handling of global parameters, and the only workaround had been to
avoid such parameter names.  This workaround is no longer
necessary. \\ \hline

\textbf{1306-SON}: Fix FROM and TO qualifiers for DC mode measures &
The \texttt{FROM} and \texttt{TO} qualifiers would work correctly if
either both were used on a \texttt{.MEASURE DC} line, or if neither
was used.  Measures such as these now also work correctly for all
supported DC measure types:
\begin{verbatim}
.measure dc maxFrom max v(1) FROM=4
.measure dc minTo min v(1) TO=4
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

\textbf{1303-SON}: Segfault in mixed signal interface &
The Python method \texttt{getDeviceNames()}, and the underlying
\texttt{xyce\_getDeviceNames()} method in the mixed signal interface,
would segfault if invoked for some model groups (e.g, D, L and M) when
there were no devices from that model group in the \Xyce{} netlist.
\\ \hline

\textbf{807-SON}: BSIM4 convergence problems with non-zero rgatemod value &
An error in the implementation of the BSIM4 device led to convergence
problems (e.g., the \Xyce{} simulation failing part way through and
exiting with ``time step is too small'') when the \texttt{rgatemod}
parameter was non-zero. \textbf{Note: this issue was actually fixed in
Xyce release 7.1 but was inadvertently left out of its release
notes.} \\ \hline

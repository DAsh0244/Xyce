\textbf{1203-SON}: Issues with temperature-dependent device
instance-parameters that were expression-based & The values for
temperature-dependent device instance parameters could be incorrect
if their expression used a global parameter. This could occur if the
default temperature of 27C was used.  It could also occur if the
temperature was set with a \texttt{.OPTIONS DEVICE} line or via
\texttt{.STEP}.  A simple example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.GLOBAL_PARAM GTEMP=37
R1 1 0 1  TC=0.1 temp={GTEMP}
\end{verbatim}
If the temperature was set with a \texttt{.OPTIONS DEVICE} line then
the use of a ``normal'' parameter in their expression could also give
an incorrect answer.  An example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.PARAM ptemp=10
R2 2 0 1  TC=0.1 temp={temp+ptemp}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Gitlab Issue 101, SON BUG 274}:  Remove deprecated parsing of quoted filename to table &
Double quoted strings were once parsed as filenames into a lookup table.  That syntax 
has been deprecated for some time and has now been removed. Use the \texttt{tablefile(``filename'')}
syntax to read a file into a table.  A double quoted string is 
now only interpreted as a string.  Additionally, the syntax \texttt{string(``'')} 
has also been removed as it was used to signify a string.

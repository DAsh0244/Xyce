Default phase output is now in degrees.  & The default \Xyce{} output for phase
operators, such as \texttt{VP()}, \texttt{IP()}, \texttt{SP()}, \texttt{YP()}
and \texttt{ZP()}, and for AC sensitivities is now in degrees.  For compatibility
with other simulators like Spice3f5 and ngspice, it is possible to change those
outputs to still use radians via:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS OUTPUT PHASE\_OUTPUT\_RADIANS=TRUE
\end{vquote}
\\ \hline

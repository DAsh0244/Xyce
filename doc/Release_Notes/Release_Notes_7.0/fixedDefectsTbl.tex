\textbf{1257-SON}: Let Xyce/ADMS support JFET model types &
In prior versions, Xyce/ADMS supported use of
the \texttt{xyceModelGroup} module attribute to define a model as
being a MOSFET, BJT, Diode, resistor, or capacitor, and plug into Xyce
using the same spice format as other models of that type.  As of this
release, JFET is also supported. \\ \hline
\textbf{1256-SON}: Xyce/ADMS analog function error &
Xyce/ADMS would emit an error about an undefined variable if one
used \$vt as the input argument to an analog function that had both
input and output arguments. \\ \hline
\textbf{1252-SON}: Xyce segfaults when .OPTIONS OUTPUT PRINTHEADER=FALSE
is used  &  Xyce would segfault if a \texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT PRINTHEADER=FALSE}
line was used and the netlist contained either a \texttt{.PRINT SENS} line
for an AC analysis or a \texttt{.PRINT ES} line.

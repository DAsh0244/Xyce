Release 6.11.1 is a patch release that fixes a small number of bugs in
Xyce Release 6.11.0.  This file describes the changes made between
Xyce 6.11.0 and 6.11.1.

  - A bug in the handling of binning (Reference Guide section 2.1.17.2)
    when applied to the BSIM6, PSP102, or MVSG-HV FET models was fixed,
    and this technique now works correctly for those models.

  - The C and Q instance parameters are allowed to be solution-dependent
    for the C-device.  In Xyce 6.11, or earlier, an attempt to use an
    expression (that did not depend on solution variables such as nodal
    voltages) in the definition of other parameters, such as TEMP, for
    the C device would cause a parsing error.  This is fixed now.

\textbf{1198-SON}: Binning doesn't work for BSIM6 and other models in the ADMS directory &
Binning (the kind enabled by \texttt{.options parser
model\_binning=true} did not work properly for several MOSFET models
derived from Verilog-A, because the authors of those models had not
included the dummy
parameters \textbf{LMIN}, \textbf{LMAX}, \textbf{WMIN},
and \textbf{WMAX}.  These dummy parameters are not used directly by
any model, but must be present in order for the binning code to select
the correct model card from a collection of cards based on
the \textbf{L} and \textbf{W} parameter on the instance line.  These
models were BSIM6, PSP102, MVSG-HV, and the non-free EKV models.
Dummy parameters have been added for all these models and they should
now work with binning. \\ \hline
\textbf{989-SON}: I(*) will not print branch currents that are part of a Y
device & Until this release of \Xyce{}, the I(*) feature of
the \texttt{.PRINT} would not output any branch currents (extra
solution variables describing internal currents of a device)
associated with Y devices.  No Y devices in \Xyce{} have such branch
currents, but Y devices imported from Verilog-A plugins could.  These
branch currents are now output by I(*).

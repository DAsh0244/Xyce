\textbf{1273-SON}: Bug fixes for FIND-WHEN and WHEN measures for all analysis modes &
Several issues with the \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and \texttt{WHEN} measures, for \texttt{AC},
\texttt{DC} and \texttt{TRAN} measure modes, were addressed for this release.  First,
the right-hand side of the equality in the \texttt{WHEN} clause can now be an expression.
An example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.MEASURE DC whenExample1 when v(2)={v(1)+1}
\end{verbatim}
The second issue was that the interpolation algorithm for determining the time
(or frequency or DC sweep value) at which the \texttt{WHEN} clause was satisifed
could be inaccurate if the \texttt{WHEN} clause used varying quantities.
An example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.MEASURE AC whenExample2 when vr(1)=vi(1)
\end{verbatim}
The third issue was that, especially for \texttt{TRAN} measures, the \texttt{WHEN}
clause could miss some of the crossings if that clause used varying quantities.

\textbf{1271-SON}: Incorrect error handling for .PRINT AC when .LIN is used with
.STEP & An attempt to print out an S-,Y- or Z-parameter value via a .PRINT AC line
would cause a parsing error when .LIN was used with .STEP.

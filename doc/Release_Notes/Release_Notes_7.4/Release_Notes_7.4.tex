\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item place holder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item placeholder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item placeholder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item ``Continuous mode'' measures, that may return more than one
    result, are now supported for the \texttt{DERIV-AT},
    \texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-AT}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and
    \texttt{WHEN} measure types for \texttt{.AC}, \texttt{.DC},
    \texttt{.NOISE} and \texttt{.TRAN} analyses.
  \item The \texttt{-remeasure} command line option now supports
    \Xyce{} output files made with \texttt{FORMAT=GNUPLOT}.
  \item The full range of negative values (-1,-2,-3,...) are now
    supported for the \texttt{RISE}, \texttt{FALL} and \texttt{CROSS}
    qualifiers for the \texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and
    \texttt{WHEN} measure types.
  \item The \texttt{ERROR} measure type is now supported for
    \texttt{.AC} and \texttt{.NOISE} analyses.
  \item Additional window functions (\texttt{BARTLETTHANN},
    \texttt{BLACKMAN}, \texttt{NUTTALL}, \texttt{COSINE2},
    \texttt{COSINE4}, \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE}, \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE3}
    and \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE6}) have been added for \texttt{.FFT}
    lines.  In addtional, both ``symmetric'' and ''periodic'' versions
    are now supported for all window functions.
  \item \texttt{.OPTIONS FFT FFT\_MODE=<0|1>} now allows the \Xyce{}
    user to select whether the \Xyce{} \texttt{.FFT} processing and
    output is more compatible with HSPICE (0) or Spectre (1).  The
    default is HSPICE.
  \item \texttt{.STEP} analyses now support \texttt{.FOUR} analyses.
  \item A bug in the handling of wildcard current output was fixed and
    now these wildcards may be requested using the external output API
    irrespective of whether the netlist being run contains print lines
    outputting the same data.
  \item More complex \texttt{.PRINT} line wildcards, such as VR(X1*) and
IR(B1?), are now supported for all voltage and current operators.  So, this
feature now also supports the VR, VI, VM, VP, VDB, IR, II, IM, IP and IDB
operators used for \texttt{.AC}, \texttt{.HB} and \texttt{.NOISE} analysis.
It also now supports the lead current operators IB, IC, ID, IE, IG and IS.
  \item All valid \texttt{.PRINT} line wildcards are now supported for
numerical lead-current designators, such as I1 and I2.  (Note: At present,
those designators are only supported for the T and YGENEXT devices.)

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item placeholder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item The link line required to link \Xyce{} libraries (installed by
  ``make install'') to user code has been simplified.  Now only
  ``-lxyce'' is needed, where in previous releases it was necessary to
  link in several related libraries.

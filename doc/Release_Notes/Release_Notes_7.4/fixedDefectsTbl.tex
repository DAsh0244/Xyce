     placeholder explanation \\ \hline
\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 204/Github issue 24}: Interlibrary dependency problems &
     For user-compiled and installed Xyce builds beginning with
     release 6.1 and up to release 7.3, Xyce created and installed
     multiple, interdependent libraries such as ``libxyce'',
     ``libADMS'' and ``libNeuronModels'', all of which had to be
     linked into any user code that used Xyce.  As of release 7.4,
     only libxyce is installed, and it contains all functions
     previously placed into the other libraries.  If you are building
     codes to be linked against Xyce libraries, you must simplify your
     link line to link in just ``-lxyce''.\\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 204}: \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASFAIL=1} does not work
properly for successful \texttt{TRIG-TARG} measures  & If \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASFAIL=1}
was used in a netlist then the results for a successful \texttt{TRIG-TARG} measure
would be correct in the descriptive information sent to stdout.  However, the measure's
value would be shown as FAILED in the \texttt{<netlistName>.mt0} file. \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 229}: Parsing error when V() expression contains extraneous trailing spaces &
The new expression library did not handle whitespace correctly, in certain contexts.  
  This has been fixed in the expression lexer.
  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 235}: Extend the R=0 capability to allow use of resistor .MODELs & 
Resistors that have a resistance value of zero are treated different inside of Xyce.  
  This different handling did not allow for such resistors to refer to \texttt{.MODEL} statements.  
  That has been fixed and now this use case works.
  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 239}: \texttt{.options parser scale} doesn't play nice with dependent parameters & 
If Xyce was used with a PDK that used \texttt{.option scale} (or Xyce's version \texttt{.options parser scale}), Xyce would apply this scale factor in the Instance::processParams function of the relevant MOSFET devices.  However, if the device instance contained any dependent parameters, then every time those parameters were updated, this function was called again, and thus the scale factor was applied each time. This resulted in the wrong L and W values.  This has been corrected and scale factors are now applied no more than once.
  \\ \hline

  \textbf{1145-SON}: \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} does not work in \texttt{.IC} statements &  
      This has been resolved and global parameters can be used to set the 
      value of an \texttt{.IC} statement.\\ \hline

  \textbf{1029-SON}: Improve checking of \texttt{.PRINT} type versus analysis type &  
The checking of the \texttt{.PRINT} type versus the analysis type had some
deficiencies. It would falsely report an error if a \texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} line
preceeded the \texttt{.PRINT TRAN} line.  It could falsely not report an error if
the \texttt{.OP} statement preceeded the primary analysis statement (e.g., 
\texttt{.TRAN}), or if a valid \texttt{.PRINT} line was the first \texttt{.PRINT}
line in the netlist but a subsequent \texttt{.PRINT} line was not allowed
for the requested primary analysis type. \\ \hline

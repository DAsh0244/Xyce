Continued support for FRAC\_MAX qualifier on TRIG-TARG measure lines &
For backwards compatibility with previous \Xyce{} versions for internal
users, \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE USE\_LTTM=<value>} has been added.  This
option defaults to 0, which uses the new version of the TRIG-TARG measure;
while setting it to 1 will use the old version of the TRIG-TARG measure
for all TRIG-TARG measures in the netlist.  If the FRAC\_MAX qualifier is
used on a TRIG-TARG line then \Xyce{} will automatically default to
\texttt{USE\_LTTM=1} for that particular measure line.  \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 338}: Added the function \texttt{Simulator:: getTimeVoltagePairsSz} & The function
\texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairsSz} supplies the maximun 
number of time, voltage or state values for an ADC in a subsequent call to 
\texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairs} or \texttt{Simulator::getTimeStatePairs}.
Also, calling \texttt{Simulator::getTimeStatePairs} no longer clears the voltage
history of an ADC, so a calling program that needs both state and voltage history
can first call \texttt{Simulator::getTimeStatePairs} and then call 
\texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairs} to get both.  Calling 
\texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairs} still clears the ADC history.
See the Application note, Mixed Signal Simulation with \Xyce{} 7.5 for further 
details.

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 319}:  Improve error checking for invalid
.MEASURE lines & The error checking for invalid \texttt{DERIV-AT},
\texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-AT}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and
\texttt{WHEN} measures has been improved.  Some invalid measure
lines that would previously be reported as ``FAILED'' are now
correctly reported as parsing errors. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 289} Improvements to TRIG-TARG measure &
Separate \texttt{TD} (time delay) and/or \texttt{AT} qualifiers
are now allowed for both the \texttt{TRIG} and \texttt{TARG} 
clauses.  Expression support has also been improved.  Previously,
expressions did not work correctly in the \texttt{TARG} clause.
Examples are as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
.TRAN 0 1
.MEASURE TRAN M1 TRIG V(1)=0.5 CROSS=1 TD=0.3
+ TARG V(1)=0.5 CROSS=1 TD=0.8
.MEASURE TRAN M2 TRIG AT=0.05 
+ TARG V(1)=0.5 CROSS=1
.MEASURE TRAN M3 TRIG V(1)=0.5
+ CROSS=1 TARG AT=0.8
\end{verbatim}

Xyce will now properly report M1 = 0.5 with targ = 0.875 and
trig = 0.375, M2 = 0.075 with targ = 0.125 and trig = 0.05, and
M3 = 0.675 with targ = 0.8 and trig = 0.125.
\\ \hline 

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 220}:  .MEASURE trig/targ doesn't match ngspice
when there is negative setup time. & Previous \Xyce{} versions would
not return a negative value from a \texttt{TRIG-TARG} measure. The 
\texttt{TARG} clause would only be evaluated if the \texttt{TRIG} clause
was satisfied.  A measure line such as this will now properly return 
M4 = -0.5 with targ = 0.25 and trig = 0.75, instead of
failing to find the targ time.

\begin{verbatim}
VPWL2 2 0 pwl(0 0 0.5 1 1 0)
.MEASURE TRAN M4 TRIG V(2)=0.5 CROSS=2
+ TARG V(2)=0.5 CROSS=1
\end{verbatim}
 \\ \hline
